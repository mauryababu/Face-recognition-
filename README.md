Real-time face recognition is a computer vision application that identifies and verifies a person from a digital image or video frame in real time.
1. It is one of the most widely used computer vision applications and a fundamental
    problem in computer vision and pattern recognition.
2. The primary objective of face detection algorithms is to accurately and efficiently
    determine the presence and position of faces in an image or video.
3. The algorithms analyze the visual content of the data, searching for patterns and
  features that correspond to facial characteristics.
4. Facial recognition is used in multiple areas such as content-based image
  retrieval, video coding, video conferencing, crowd video surveillance, and intelligent human-computer interfaces.
5. It is also used as part of access control or identify verification solutions.
